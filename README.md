# File Census - Downloads Organisation System

A Python-based file management system designed to help organise and clean up accumulated files, particularly the Downloads folder. Integrates seamlessly with Obsidian for weekly review workflows.

This is a personal productivity project, learning in public and shared with the PKM community.  Written with the help of Claude Code.

## Overview

Over the years, it's easy to accumulate thousands of files across various folders, start organisation processes, forget how they worked, and then start again. This system provides a systematic approach to file analysis and organisation, generating reports that can be integrated into your Obsidian vault for regular review and action.

## Features

- **File system scanning** with detailed metadata collection
- **Obsidian integration** via Templater plugin
- **Multiple output formats** (CSV and Markdown)
- **Subfolder analysis** with size and file count summaries
- **Weekly review workflows** with actionable insights
- **Cross-drive compatibility** (works with any drive/folder structure)

## Quick Start - Weekly Review Only

**For the core weekly review workflow, you only need:**
- `downloads_weekly_review.py` - The main script
- `hello.py` - For testing setup
- Obsidian with Templater plugin

**Skip to:** [Obsidian Setup](#obsidian-setup-with-templater) and [downloads_weekly_review.py](#downloads_weekly_reviewpy) sections.

## Obsidian Setup with Templater

### Prerequisites
- Obsidian with Templater plugin installed
- Python installed and accessible from command line
- File Census scripts in accessible location

### Templater Configuration

1. **Enable User System Command Functions**
   - Go to Obsidian Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins ‚Üí Templater
   - Find "User System Command Functions" section
   - Enable "User System Command Functions" (accept the security warning)

2. **Add User Functions**
   - Click "Add New User Function"
   - **Function Name**: `echo` (keep short and simple...had issue with long name)
   - **System Command**: `python J:/_learning/claude/file-census/downloads_weekly_review.py`
   - Save settings and restart Obsidian

3. **Create Weekly Template**
   ```markdown
   # Weekly Downloads Review - <% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD") %>
   
   <% tp.user.echo() %>
   
   ## Actions Taken
   - [ ] Review large files
   - [ ] Clean up old files
   - [ ] Organise recent downloads
   ```

4. **Usage**
   - Create a new note from your template
   - Run Templater: Replace templates in active file (Ctrl+P)
   - Review the generated analysis and take action

## Core Files

### downloads_weekly_review.py ‚≠ê **MAIN SCRIPT**
**Purpose**: Comprehensive Downloads folder analysis designed for weekly reviews.

**Features**:
- **Summary Statistics**: Total files, date range, total size, average file size
- **Top 15 Largest Files**: Identifies space hogs with sizes and dates
- **Recent Files**: All files from the last 7 days for quick review
- **15 Oldest Files**: Finds forgotten files that might need cleanup
- **Subfolder Analysis**: 
  - Lists all subfolders in Downloads
  - File count and total size per subfolder
  - Most recent file date in each subfolder
- **Direct Markdown Output**: Ready for Obsidian/Templater integration

**Usage**:
```bash
python downloads_weekly_review.py
```

**Sample Output Structure**:
```markdown
# Downloads Weekly Review

## Summary
- Total files: 801
- Date range: 2020-03-15 to 2025-07-31
- Total size: 2.3 GB
- Average file size: 2.9 MB

## üî• Top 15 Largest Files

```

### hello.py
**Purpose**: Simple test script for validating Python and Templater integration.

**Features**:
- Prints greeting and current timestamp
- Minimal dependencies
- Perfect for testing Templater User Function setup

**Usage**:
```bash
python hello.py
```

## Supplemental Files (Development Journey)

*These files were created during the development process and are not required for the weekly review workflow. They're included for users who want alternative approaches or to understand the evolution of the project.*

### file_census.py
**Purpose**: Basic file system scanner that creates comprehensive CSV output.

**Features**:
- Scans specified directory recursively
- Outputs: filename, path, size, modification date, file extension
- CSV format suitable for spreadsheet analysis
- Handles large directories efficiently

**Usage**: 
```bash
python file_census.py
```

**Note**: This was the initial approach before developing the integrated Markdown output. Use this if you prefer CSV data for external analysis.

### summary_report.py
**Purpose**: Converts CSV data into readable Markdown reports.

**Features**:
- Reads CSV output from file_census.py
- Creates formatted Markdown summaries
- Basic statistics and file type analysis
- Obsidian-ready output format

**Usage**:
```bash
python summary_report.py
```

**Note**: This bridges the gap between CSV output and Markdown reports. The functionality has been integrated into `downloads_weekly_review.py` for a streamlined workflow.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Obikburgh/file-census.git
   cd file-census
   ```

2. **Ensure Python is installed**:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

3. **Test basic functionality**:
